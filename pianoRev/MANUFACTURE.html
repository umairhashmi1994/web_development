				<h1><b>STEINWAY & SONS GRAND PIANOS <br>“MADE IN GERMANY”</b></h1>
				<p>Hardly any other company can look back on such a rich history of success and tradition as &nbsp;&nbsp; the company founded by Henry E. Steinway and his sons in 1853 in New York, Steinway &<br> Sons. The instruments are manufactured in New York and Hamburg. STEINWAY & SONS<br> Grand Pianos and pianos have long been standard in the music world and retain their value<br> over time. They have all the characteristics that are decisive worldwide. <br><br>
				The choice of first-class materials and, above all, the meticulous craftsmanship that still<br> characterize each and every Steinway & Sons, which are to this day mostly handmade, make<br> it a privilege to own such a jewel. The aura unique to all STEINWAY pianos emanates from<br> our newly restored instruments at a price that is significantly lower than that of a new<br> instrument. All models have a rich range of sound nuances. The midrange, treble and<br> basses are tonally fully balanced with the typical first-class, brilliant sound of<br> STEINWAY&SONS. They impress with their unmistakable versatility and are equipped with<br> everything that makes a Steinway so unique.</p>
